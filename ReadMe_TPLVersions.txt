Note on tpl versions:
2013-09-18 CPT version is tpl used to run 2013 assessment (but does not compile on Mac))
2013-10-29 corrected errors to compile on Mac and turned on RKF fm devs in recent time period
current tpl is CPT version that reads model control file name from model configuration, but is otherwise identical
to the 2013-09-18 CPT version (except for fixing small errors that kept it from compiling on the Mac)
